# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status

*   **Overall:** Memory Bank initialization is partially complete. The core application structure exists, but specific features are in varying states of completion. Technical details have been extracted from configuration files and incorporated into the Memory Bank.
*   **Key Area:** Populating the Memory Bank with technical details.

## 2. What Works

*   [List features or components confirmed to be functional.]
    *   Basic Laravel application structure is present and confirmed to be version `^8.54`.
    *   Authentication scaffolding (Fortify/Jetstream Livewire stack) is likely functional at a basic level.
    *   Core models (`User`, `Admin`, `Order`, `Staff`, `Faculty`, `Notification`, `PatronType`, `PushSubscription`) are defined.
    *   Migrations for database tables exist.
    *   Frontend and Backend view structures are in place (using Livewire/Blade/Alpine.js/Tailwind).
    *   Memory Bank core files created and partially populated with technical details.
    *   Database connection confirmed to be MySQL.
    *   Email (SMTP) and Web Push notification configurations are present.
    *   Pusher is configured for real-time events.
    *   PDF generation (`laravel-dompdf`) and Excel handling (`maatwebsite/excel`) libraries are integrated.
    *   Thai date formatting (`phattarachai/thaidate`) library is integrated.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Implement

    *   Specific functionality within Backend administration panels (CRUD operations for Staff, Faculty, Orders, etc.).
    *   Full implementation of the Reporting feature.
    *   Refinement and testing of the Notification system (Email and Web Push, Pusher).
    *   Frontend user interface details and workflows.
    *   Seeding initial data (if required).
    *   Testing (Unit, Feature, Integration).
    *   Populating Memory Bank files with project-specific details (Project Name, Purpose, Goals, Scope, Stakeholders - requires user input).
    *   [Add other specific pending tasks]

## 4. Known Issues / Bugs

    *   None identified yet, pending detailed review and testing.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
